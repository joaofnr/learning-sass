This is a very simple HTML page that is part of a SASS course in alura.com.br

I decided to publish here so i can visit and review anytime to improve my skills and learn better. If it helps anyone out there learning SASS, i'll be happy to know!

Well, there's not much here, seriously. Just a page to play around with SASS with good practices, organization and, maybe, collaboration - and that's up to you, if you like.
